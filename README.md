# DNS-Server-Go

## Project Abstract

### This project is a from-scratch implementation of a basic DNS server. It explores the mechanics of the DNS protocol â€” the backbone of how domain names are resolved to IP addresses on the internet.

### Throughout the project, the server evolves from a simple UDP listener to a fully functional DNS responder capable of parsing, constructing, and forwarding DNS queries.

- Key Features & Learning Milestones
- Set up a UDP server to listen for DNS queries
- Construct DNS responses (header, question, and answer sections)
- Parse DNS query packets, including compressed formats
- Support common DNS record types
- Build a forwarding DNS server that proxies queries to an upstream resolver

### I'm building this project to better understand low-level networking, binary protocol parsing, and the internal workings of how domain resolution happens on the internet.
